# Soldering Station T12 @ STC15F2K60S2-28I-LQFP32
Hey all, 

- My old product is damaged, I want something stronger, faster, etc ....
More details about the product: Video update
  - T12 with a capacity of 72W, works most strongly at 24V> = 3A. It only takes about 5 ~ 7 seconds. You can check it out for yourself. When you came back it was a few times stronger: D: lol:
  
Current firmware: power-on password lock, password-lock temperature, 3 types of soldering iron parameters to save and recall functions (should be enough to be confused), double-click and click Shortcuts (function included one strong temperature button, turn off one button, sleep one button, three temperature switches, head switch, etc.), set the sensitivity of the vibration switch, adjust the volume and adjust the frequency, adjust the time Sleep More than 20 personalized settings, such as adjusting shutdown time, screen off automatically, low voltage alarm, etc., each function can be selected to close and open. There are many options for screensaver display mode (temperature display only, display clock, display logo, etc.)
 
Normal users can directly use the default settings, no need to set directly to use, to adjust the default restore value, easy to use. Press and hold for 3 seconds, then you can enter the menu after listening and you can set the interface without any instructions.

I do not have the correct device to adjust the temperature yet. So sad. But around 180o  Celsius, it's too strong to melt everything.

Why it is STC and not STM, because it is quite difficult to order it plus MCP602 (AD822). : lol:


Because the thermocouple parameters of different welding irons vary by even several tens of degrees, the temperature adjustment parameters of the three soldering irons built into the soldering station can be transferred. exchange at any time. - Xi'an head, soldering iron head No. 3 - original head, users can also correct the parameters according to the actual situation.

Temperature increases rapidly, good temperature recovery properties, good or bad temperature index, mainly depends on heating capacity when the temperature is within 30 degrees of the set temperature. Our commitment is like a soldering station with a temperature better than this one (within a tolerance of 4%)

Can replace LM7805 with LM2596T-5V, it will be more cool.
- Sorry for bad english.
